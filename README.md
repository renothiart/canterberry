# The Canterberry Tales
### A game by Amy Chen, Reno Thiart and Frank Masuelli
Welcome to **The Canterberry Tales!** Chaucer is great and all, but why doesn't he write about fruits? We needed to address this long-standing ~~grape~~ gripe!

The Canterberry Tales is a narrative game about exploring a medieval land of bards and berries across storybook levels, taking on the role of a feudal fruit and discovering what awaits you. It is our first game and we hope you enjoy it!

## Controls
The game is designed to be played on a keyboard with WASD or arrow key movement.

- Move your character left and right with '←'/'→' or 'A' / 'D'.
- Some levels allow you to go forward or backward - '↑'/'↓' or 'W'/'S' will do the trick!
- Press 'E'/'SPACE' to interact with characters and objects.
- Press 'Q' in the campfire area for a change of perspective midway through the game... you'll know when it is time!

## Notes
Created for Godot Wild Jam #70 with the theme 'Folklore', incorporating the 'Transfer Takeover' wildcard. 

When we saw the theme, we quickly honed in on the importance of storytelling to folklore and decided we wanted to channel a classic story about spinning tales. From there, the game designed itself! (with lots of help from us)

## Fun Fact
Chaucer did actually write about one forgotten fruit, the open-arse. We decided to go more family friendly. The more you know!
